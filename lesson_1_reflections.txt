How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The diff can show exactly what is different between two documents that can help me find out bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    That will be much easier that help me to find differents during the program processing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: the commit is helping me to remember what kind of changes I did at this time.
    Cons: but if commit many times, it will have a little frustration.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think Git is good for programming development, since a samle change in an application may changed multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will not need to worry about my changes could break the application or not, since I can compare different between two versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to try to use Git to save my reflection text.
