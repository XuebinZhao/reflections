When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want to work with other programmer.
	When I need to work at different computers (company or home).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because pull from the remote can work on different branch locally, then I need to make sure what branch I want to get pull from remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks:  it's copying repository from others' from github
	clones: copying repository from github to local, or from local to local
	branches: they represent different version for different purposes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This is a double safty for programming.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	If I collaborate without using Git, that I have work with others in same physical location.
	It is much easier if I can use Git or GitHub.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When I want to create or test a new function or feature.
	The benefits are we don't need to worry about the new function could mess up the main function.
